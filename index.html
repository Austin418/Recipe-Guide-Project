    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">This recipe makes <em>quick</em>, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</h2>
  
    <p>Hummus is a <em><strong>delicious</strong></em> thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
  
    <h3 style="color: chocolate;">Ingredients</h3>
  
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: chocolate;">Instructions</h3>
  
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>For<strong> a different flavour,</strong> you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
  
    <h3 style="color: chocolate;">Storage</h3>
  
    <ul>
    <li>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</li>
  
    <li>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li>
    </ul>
